# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive application developed as part of the Taller de Programación course at the Universidad de la República. The aim was to create trabajo.uy, a sophisticated job management system that facilitates the posting, management, and application to job offers via a web-based platform. This system was designed to provide practical experience in applying complex software development techniques and to simulate a real-world software development environment.
